# Hack the 6ix Intro to AI-enhanced Apps Workshop

To install:
- Python 3.10
  - Download from python homepage or
  - [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [Pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win)


Setup the venv
```
python -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate # On Mac/Linux
.venv/bin/Activate.ps1  # on Windows
```

Then, once you're done that, install the requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We're not using Conda for this because we want a lightweight environment for a quick workshop. Your project (for this hackathon) may vary.
